%Write a function called eligible that helps the admission officer of the Graduate School of Vanderbilt University decide whether the applicant is eligible for admission based on GRE scores. 
% The function takes two positive scalars called v and q as input and returns the logical admit as output. They represent the percentiles of the verbal and quantitative portions of the GRE respectively. 
% You do not need to check the inputs.
% The applicant is eligible if the average percentile is at least 92% and both of the individual percentiles are over 88%. 
% The function returns logical true or false value. 

function admit=eligible(v,q);
avg=(v+q)/2;
if avg>=92 && v>88 && q>88;
    admit=true;
else
    admit=false;
end
